# Kinova_Mico2-ROS-LLM-Integration-ROS-MCP-Server.
This project demonstrates a ROS-based pick-and-stack robotic system using the Kinova Mico 2 robotic arm, where high-level task planning is handled using a Claude Large Language Model (LLM).  The robot autonomously performs pick and stacking operations using natural-language, ros-mcp-server and executing them through a ROS control pipeline.
